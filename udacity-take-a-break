1. Install Python on Your Computer
Here are both the Windows and Mac instructions to get up and running with Python. (If you already have Python installed, go ahead and skip to step 3.)

2. Open IDLE and Create a New File
Once you have Python installed, open IDLE. IDLE is the name of the place where you can write Python code. Open it on your computer.

On Windows: Go to Start -> Programs -> Python -> Idle
On a Mac: Type “Idle” in Spotlight

Create a new file by selecting: File -> New Window

3. Save and Run Your Program
The first thing we need to learn is to open a web browser with a YouTube URL. The following code does exactly that.

import webbrowser

webbrowser.open("http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXw16RzMofo")
Save the program; call it takeabreak.py. Now run the program: Run -> Run Module

The YouTube video should open. Try changing the URL to your favorite video.

4. Set Your Time for Your Video to Open
The next step is to set the amount of time before the video opens. Here’s how to make that happen.

import time
import webbrowser

time.sleep(10)
webbrowser.open("http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXw16RzMofo")
Now run this. The program should now wait 10 seconds before launching the browser. Play around with the number of seconds. For example, 2 hours = 7,200 seconds.

5. Add a Loop to Your Reminder
As a final step, let’s add a loop to launch the browser multiple times during the day.

import time
import webbrowser

total_breaks = 3
break_count = 0

while(break_count < total_breaks):
    time.sleep(10)
    webbrowser.open("http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXw16RzMofo")
    break_count = break_count + 1
That’s it! Show your program to a friend, and to learn more, head over to the Programming Foundations with Python course.


'''

import webbrowser
import time

breaks = 3
count = 0

#print("startet um" + time.ctime())


while (count < breaks):
    time.sleep(5)
    webbrowser.open("http:www.spiegel.de")
    breaks = breaks - 1
exit()
